# WELCOME TO RANDOM CHOMSKY GENERATOR

This project is the second iteration of a personal project that I have developed while studying to become a programmer at Makers Academy. It allows you to generate random sentence structures and also random sentences.

Inspired by the early works of linguist Noam Chomsky, this project follows these requirements:
  1. Generate random sentence structures
  2. Generate random sentences based on random sentence structures
  3. Resulting sentences have to be both grammatical AND meaningless.

An alternative version of this project, in Ruby, is [here](github.com/guilhe0756/your-random-chomsky).

## Objective

To request data from an API and use the result to generate grammatical and meaningless sentences.

## Approach



## Tech stack

JavaScript (with Jasmine for testing and Eslint for linting).

### Developed by
